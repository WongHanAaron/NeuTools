# Neural Network Primer
Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that uses what is called a series 'perception' structures that can be trained to perform a task. 

The training process involves taking a set of training data (for example images), and continually performing a training process on the neural network model. For neural networks, this involves taking the data that is available, splitting it between a training set (usually 70% of the data) and a testing/validation set (the remainder).
