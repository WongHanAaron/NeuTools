# Developer Reference
The landing space for all documentation required for fellow developers to get started with developing quickly!

## Table of Contents
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Running the Project](#running-the-project)

# Prerequisites
Section for any pre-work that is required by the developers when starting to do development.

## Package Installation
Be sure to install customtkinter and tkinter. \
Type the following in your terminal: \
```
pip install customtkinter
pip install tkinter
```

We'll setup a resources file soon I promise :)

# Running The Project
Section for any documentation on how to run the project in the current commit.
## UI
To start the UI, open the file 'main_window.py' within Visual Studio Code.
You can find the file in 'src\ui\main_window.py'. Then click the run button on the top-right hand corner of the open file. 

Someday, we'll abstract all of this into a main.py file closer to the root :)
